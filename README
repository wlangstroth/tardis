TARDIS
======

A program for time tracking.


Overview
--------

Records the current time and project string entered by inserting into an event
table in Sqlite3.


Event Types
-----------

The events recorded should be:

* start (... work on a project)
* stop
* export

The 'export' event demarcates the last export, so that when exporting to an
external program, only the relevant information is sent.


TODO
----

* Batch export to Harvest (harvestapp.com)


Dependencies
------------

Tested with clang (http://clang.llvm.org/), but should work with any c compiler.
