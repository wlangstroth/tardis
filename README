TARDIS
======

Time tracking for Timelords!

Or people who spend most of their time on the command line, and always forget
to open that browser window, sign in, bugger about with the mouse until
some drop-down gives you the correct time, click on the project, find the
activity, select the ... oh, screw it! I'm writing my own!

Note: this really is for Timelords. There isn't any serious error handling, and
if you screw up, your best bet is to fix things with sql commands.


Usage
-----

To create a new entry,

    $ tardis start project "a description of the project"

To stop for the day,

    $ tardis stop

You can also shorten "start" to "s", like so:

    $ tardis s another-project "this is a different project"

Other subcommands:

    $ tardis all

shows you all of your entries in an attractive format.

    $ tardis r[eport]

shows you the amount of time you've spent on different projects.
